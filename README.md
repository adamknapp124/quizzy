# Quizzy - the AI powered self testing application
Quizzy is a web application designed to help users create, customize, and take quizzes on a variety of topics. Users can easily build interactive quizzes by adding questions, setting answer choices, and determining correct answers. The application supports quiz-takers with real-time feedback and scoring, making it a useful tool for educators, students, or anyone looking to test their knowledge. It can also serve as a platform for creating study aids or engaging in fun trivia challenges with friends.

## Features
### Create Custom Quizzes
Users can create a quiz about any subject. You need only to supply the questions and correct answer, AI will handle the rest by filling in incorrect, but close answers to turn any question into multiple choice.

## Future Features
- In the future I would like to add the ability to create an entire quiz of the users specified amount of questions, just by specifying the grade level and subject the quiz should be about.
- As the quizzes created by any user are available to any user, you can filter them to only see quizzes you create, but a leaderboard for time/scares will be my next feature
